1. Explain how merge sort works in general.

2. Perform the merging process manually on {3, 4, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 11}.

3. Perform merge sort manually on {7, 3, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5, 11}.

4.
  a. Create a method that takes as input an array of int and performs merge sort on the array.
  b. Create a method that takes as input an ArrayList of Integer and performs merge sort on the array.
  
5. What is the advantage of using merge sort instead of bubble, selection, and insertion sort?


Challenge Problem:

6. An inversion in an array is a pair of elements such that the element to the left is greater than the element to the right.
For example, {1, 3, 2, 5, 4} has 2 inversions (2, 3) and (4, 5), while {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} has 10 inversions (every pair of elements).
Create a method that takes as input an array of int and returns the number of inversions in the array.
Hint: Use merge sort.

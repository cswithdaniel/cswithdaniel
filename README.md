Four levels of Java classes are designed and offered by High School Student Daniel Li (USA Computing Olympiad finalist) to cover all of the material needed to take the AP Computer Science A exam.

Since 9th grade, Daniel Li has taught 16 courses of Java at the Horizons for Youth Program in Northampton Community College (each course covers a level) with over 300 teaching hours and over 100 students in middle and high school.

## Why Java?
* Java is the most popular programming language.
  * Java can run on nearly any system.
  * Java is the only language used in AP Computer Science A.
  * Java is used to make many games.
* Java is easy to learn.
* Java is easy to debug (find mistakes in code).
* Java runs reasonably fast.

##### Compared to other popular programming languages
* Although some languages such as C++ are faster, they are much harder to learn and debug.
* Although Python is easy to learn, it is much slower than Java, and it is harder to debug in Python than in Java.
  * Python is also often too slow for many programming competitions.

## Why cswithdaniel?
* Taught by a high school student, making programming seem accessible to middle and high school students.
* Contains problem sets for each video.
* Contains curriculum that is organized. Curriculum can be used to self-study or teach.
* It is free.

## Amount of time needed

* There are 4 levels in total.
* Each level has 4 lessons, total of 16 lessons.
* Each lesson has 3 lesson parts; each level contains around 12 lesson parts, total of 48 lesson parts in 4 levels.
* Each lesson part has 10-20 minutes in video lessons.
* Each lesson part has a problem set to go along with it, and each problem set takes around 45-90 minutes for students with no prior programming experience.
* This curriculum is designed to help students self-study and help high school students teach Java.

##### For self-studying students
* Students are encouraged to do the problem sets of a lesson part before moving on to the next lesson part.

##### For high school students planning to use my curriculum to teach Java
* There are two teaching schedules I have used:
  * 12 lessons for each level, 1 lesson each week, each lesson is 60-75 minutes long (including going over practice problems) and covers the equivalent of a lesson part in the videos
  * 4 lessons for each level, 1 lesson per day, each lesson is 3 hours long and covers the equivalent of a lesson in the videos
  * Additional lessons can be dedicated to review material or test students.
  * Lesson summaries, problem sets, and exams are posted here and can be freely used in teaching.
* Teachers are encouraged to assign homework after each lesson.
* Teachers are free to use the curriculum or videos here.
